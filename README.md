### Language Translation

## Introduction
In this project, you’re going to take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation. You’ll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

## Getting the project files
The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the language-translation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer

git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git

## Softeware Required
1. Python 3.6
2. Tensorflow Library
